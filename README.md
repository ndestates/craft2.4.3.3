## About nystudio107/craft

This is an alternate scaffolding package for Craft 3 CMS projects to Pixel & Tonic's canonical [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package.
 
The project is based on [Craft CMS](https://CraftCMS.com) using a unique `templates/_boilerplate` system for web/AJAX/AMP pages, and implements a number of technologies/techniques:
 
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) Docker is used for local development; see **Setting Up Local Dev** below for details
* A base Twig templating setup as described in [An Effective Twig Base Templating Setup](https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-effective-twig-base-templating-setup)
* [webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/) is used for the build system as per [An Annotated webpack 4 Config for Frontend Web Development](https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-annotated-webpack-4-config-for-frontend-web-development)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for strictly typed JavaScript code
* [Vue.js 3.0](https://vuejs.org/) is used for some of the interactive bits on the website, and Vue.js 3.x allows us to leverage the [Composition API](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/) 
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the site-wide CSS using the [@tailwindcss/jit](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css)

* [Google AMP](https://developers.google.com/amp/) versions of the podcast episode and other pages
* Image transforms are done via a [Serverless Image Handler](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/serverless-image-handler/) lambda function, as described in the [Setting Up Your Own Image Transform Service](https://nystudio107.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-image-transform-service) article
* Static assets are stored in AWS S3 buckets with CloudFront as the CDN, as per the [Setting Up AWS S3 Buckets + CloudFront CDN for your Assets](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-aws-s3-buckets-cloudfront-distribution-with-craft-cms) article
* Implements a Service Worker via Google's [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) as per [Service Workers and Offline Browsing](https://nystudio107.com/blog/service-workers-and-offline-browsing)
* Critical CSS as per [Implementing Critical CSS on your website](https://nystudio107.com/blog/implementing-critical-css)
* Frontend error handling as per [Handling Errors Gracefully in Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/handling-errors-gracefully-in-craft-cms)
* A custom site module as per [Enhancing a Craft CMS 3 Website with a Custom Module](https://nystudio107.com/blog/enhancing-a-craft-cms-3-website-with-a-custom-module)
* CLI-based queue as per [Robust queue job handling in Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/robust-queue-job-handling-in-craft-cms)
* FastCGI Static Cache as per [Static Page Caching with Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/static-caching-with-craft-cms)
* [buddy.works](http://buddy.works/) atomic deployments

...and probably a bunch of other stuff too.

The following Craft CMS plugins are used on this site:
* [FastCGI Cache Bust](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/fastcgi-cache-bust) - to bust the FastCGI cache whenever entries are modified
* [ImageOptimize](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/imageoptimize) - for the optimized images and `srcset`s used on the site
* [Minify](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/minify) - to minify the HTML and inline JS/CSS
* [Retour](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/retour) - for setting up 404 redirects
* [SEOmatic](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/seomatic) - for handling site-side SEO
* [Twigpack](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/twigpack) - for loading webpack-generated `manifest.json` resources in a modern way
* [Typogrify](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/typogrify) - for smart quotes and other typographic ligatures
* [Webperf](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/webperf) - for monitoring web performance

## Using nystudio107/craft

This project package works exactly the way Pixel & Tonic's [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package works; you create a new project by first creating & installing the project:

    composer create-project nystudio107/craft PATH --no-install

Make sure that `PATH` is the path to your project, including the name you want for the project, e.g.:

    composer create-project nystudio107/craft craft3 --no-install

We use `--no-install` so that the composer packages for the root project are not installed.

## Setting Up Local Dev

You'll need Docker desktop for your platform installed to run the project in local development

* Set up a `.env` file in the `cms/` directory, based off of the provided `example.env`
* Set up a `.env.sh.` file in the `scripts/` directory, based off of the provided `example.env.sh`
* Start up the site by typing `make dev` in terminal in the project's root directory (the first build will be somewhat lengthy)
* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the site; the `webpack-dev-server` runs off of `http://localhost:8080`

Wait until you see the following to indicate that the PHP container is ready:

```
php_1         | Craft is installed.
php_1         | Applying changes from your project config files ... done
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: fpm is running, pid 22
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: ready to handle connections
```

...and the following to indicate that the webpack container is ready:
```
webpack_1     | <i> devmode-fm (webpack 5.9.0) compiled successfully in 12097 ms
webpack_1     | <i> [webpack-dev-middleware] Child "devmode-fm": Compiled successfully.
```

The CP login credentials are initially set as follows:

Login: `andrew@nystudio107.com` \
Password: `letmein`

Obviously change these to whatever you like as needed.

Build the production assets by typing `make build` to build the critical CSS, fonts, and other production assets. They will appear in `cms/web/dist/` (just double-click on the `report-legacy.html` and `report-modern.html` files to view them).

**N.B.:** Without authorization & credentials (which are private), the `make pulldb` will not work (it just runs `scripts/docker_pull_db.sh`). It's provided here for instructional purposes.

## Makefile Project Commands

This project uses Docker to shrink-wrap the devops it needs to run around the project.

To make using it easier, we're using a Makefile and the built-in `make` utility to create local aliases. You can run the following from terminal in the project directory:

- `make dev` - starts up the local dev server listening on `http://localhost:8000/`
- `make build` - builds the static assets via the webpack 5 buildchain
- `make clean` - shuts down the Docker containers, removes any mounted volumes (including the database), and then rebuilds the containers from scratch
- `make update` - causes the project to update to the latest Composer and NPM dependencies
- `make update-clean` - completely removes `node_modules/` & `vendor/`, then causes the project to update to the latest Composer and NPM dependencies
- `make composer xxx` - runs the `composer` command passed in, e.g. `make composer install`
- `make npm xxx` - runs the `npm` command passed in, e.g. `make npm install`
- `make pulldb` - runs the `scripts/docker_pull_db.sh` script to pull a remote database into the database container; the `scripts/.env.sh` must be set up first
- `make restoredb xxx` - runs the `scripts/docker_restore_db.sh` script to restore a local database dump into the database container; the `scripts/.env.sh` must be set up first

### Other notes

To update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers) and latest npm packages (as constrained by the `docker-config/webpack-dev-devmode/package.json` semvers), do:
```
make update
```

To start from scratch by removing `buildchain/node_modules/` & `cms/vendor/`, then update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers) and latest npm packages (as constrained by the `docker-config/webpack-dev-devmode/package.json` semvers), do:
```
make update-clean
```

To use Xdebug with VSCode install the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug ) and use the following configuration in your `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9003,
            "log": true,
            "externalConsole": false,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/project/cms": "${workspaceRoot}/cms"
            },
            "ignore": ["**/vendor/**/*.php"]
        }
    ]
}
```
